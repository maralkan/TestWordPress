I liked it, and definitely I can relate to it; i think everyone in this world could live the same way since no one is perfect right, but as the scripture in Hebrews 2:5-18 says Jesus is our example and he picked us bro, especially you who will bring help to those who feel tempted by sin and the devil. Great article Marvin keep writing you can accomplish something here.]]></description>
