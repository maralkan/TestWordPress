I read Jeremiah 2 and expected to see the sin of Israel that brought it into ruin. But I didn&#8217;t expect it to be worse. Jeremiah 2 begins to explain how God feels when we sin against him. This was flat convicting.<\/p>\n<p>I realize more and more the reality of the people forsaking God. Today, this world goes to great lengths to declare God as a myth or as some fairy tale made up to satisfy the needs of a weak people.<\/p>\n<p>But myths aside, nobody can prove or disprove God. It is up to the person whether or not they want to believe in whatever they want to believe. So when a person comes to acknowledge the existence of God, they may at first be super excited! I mean&#8230; who wouldn&#8217;t? The answer to a question so complex as this is definitely satisfying. But nonetheless it requires faith.<\/p>\n<p>Faith\u00a0is something that the Jews lacked throughout their history. Jeremiah comes at the dawn of the darkest time in Jewish history. Jeremiah is young and is not confident in the words of God. But regardless, Jeremiah has enough faith to confront Israel in its lack of commitment towards God.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The word of the Lord came to me:\u00a0<span id=\"en-NIV-18968\">\u201cGo and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem:<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u201cThis is what the Lord says:<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p>\u201c\u2018I remember the devotion of your youth,<br \/>\nhow as a bride you loved me<br \/>\nand followed me through the wilderness,<br \/>\nthrough a land not sown.<br \/>\n<span id=\"en-NIV-18969\">Israel was holy to the Lord,<\/span><br \/>\nthe firstfruits of his harvest;<br \/>\nall who devoured her were held guilty,<br \/>\nand disaster overtook them,\u2019\u201d<br \/>\ndeclares the Lord.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:left;\">\n<p><span id=\"en-NIV-18970\">Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob,<\/span><br \/>\nall you clans of Israel.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><span id=\"en-NIV-18971\">This is what the Lord says:<\/span><\/p>\n<div>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">\u201cWhat fault did your ancestors find in me,<br \/>\nthat they strayed so far from me?<br \/>\nThey followed worthless idols<br \/>\nand became worthless themselves.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Jeremiah 2:1-5 NIV<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"poetry top-05\">\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">There are a couple of points to make here. The Jews were once devoted to God! They had a strong faith and they held their own\u00a0(with God&#8217;s help) against other kingdoms. The Israelites, at this point, were people who were true followers of God. But what happened? That&#8217;s exactly the question that God asks the Israelites in verse 5. What happened?<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Today, the modern Christian is\u00a0very hard to respect. In the United States, the average &#8220;Christian&#8221; goes to church on Sundays. But is that all there is to devoting one&#8217;s life to God? There are so many churches today that preach that all you have to do is believe that God is real and that you will receive a salvation for sins. Somehow your past sins will be erased and somehow you will get to heaven. Many have also left out the part where you live your life for God. Many have left out the part where you need to repent and change!<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">Again, what did people see in God that they left him? Why is it that so many people refuse to believe in God? Is it because there was an unanswered prayer? Is it because someone who claimed to be Christian wronged them? Is it because their parents died? Is it because they think it&#8217;s silly because they think that others think it&#8217;s silly (peer pressure)? People begin to follow other idols such as the dream job, the ideal family, the American Dream, the next promotion, money. How does this compare with the God of the Universe? What happened to God being GOD? Then again, how does this apply to myself?<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">When I first became a Christian, I was very excited. I was all about making sure that everyone knew the truth regardless of whether or not they liked it. Now, of course, there are ways to talk to other people. In my nature, I wanted to put others down to show that I was right. And sadly, that turned away many people. I was so focused on trying to show others that I was right that I did many things that I laugh at today. And that&#8217;s not even that long ago!<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">And yet, I find myself thinking about what I did today. I did not have a very productive day. I did not have class today and I felt like I could take the day off. You know those days when we feel like not doing anything? Well, today was one of those days for me. But that means that I was not about my life&#8217;s purpose for a day. And since my life&#8217;s purpose is to try to align myself to God&#8217;s purpose, how can I say I had a good day? How can I say that I had a productive day? It&#8217;s crazy how the Scriptures can cut my heart&#8230;<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" style=\"text-align:left;\">This quiet time will have to continue through tomorrow. This is good stuff and I want to make sure that I have a thorough understanding.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":140,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[10,12],"tags":[15,16,8,11],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/81"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=81"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/81\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=81"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=81"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=81"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
