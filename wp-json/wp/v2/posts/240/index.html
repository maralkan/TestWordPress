I think it&#8217;s interesting how Jesus had a heart to help everyone but wanted to remain on the down low until it was his time. Curiously, there&#8217;s the aspect of Jesus that many people can often overlook.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where <strong>he prayed<\/strong>. Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: \u201cEveryone is looking for you!\u201d\u00a0Jesus replied, \u201cLet us go somewhere else\u2014to the nearby villages\u2014so I can preach there also. <strong>That is why I have come<\/strong>.\u201d So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.\u00a0\u2014 Mark 1:35-39 NIV<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Prayer and Reading<\/h3>\n<p>Jesus had a daily relationship with God. As I learn to imitate Christ, I must have a daily relationship with God. How can I be best friends with someone if I don&#8217;t talk to them? How can I say I love God if I don&#8217;t talk to him or read his Word? Again, I can reference Romans 10:17 NIV.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the <strong>word about Christ<\/strong>.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Romans 10:17 NIV<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Jesus had a daily relationship with God. But another thing to note, is that he always had time with God before he did anything throughout the day. We don&#8217;t have his prayer but it&#8217;s probably for strength. Why would anyone want to love people who are only interested in you because you provide some sort of advantage and no real friendship?\u00a0Jesus prayed and then he decided to go elsewhere so that others may hear his preaching. So far, the only thing we know is that he has preached about the coming of the kingdom of God. And since the kingdom of God has come near, people must repent and believe that it is good news!<\/p>\n<p>But what does this message that he preaches have to do with Christ? In a future post, I will talk about the kingdom of God in further detail. But it leaves me with obvious impression that Jesus is not preaching about himself. He is preaching about something important that is to come and is very near.<\/p>\n<h3>Purpose<\/h3>\n<p>When Jesus told his first disciples to follow him, he talked to fishermen with words that they knew about. He used their profession to explain to them that he has a new purpose for them. Now, these are his disciples. Today, people think that a disciple is so much more than a Christian. A Christian, for some reason, means that you go to church and have some sort of intellectual belief in a supernatural being that he\/she calls God. But a disciple is a follower, a student, a friend, an apprentice. How are they different? Is a disciple more faithful than a Christian? Is a Christian then, some term that you can use freely to say that you believe in a supernatural being?<\/p>\n<p>In the Greek, \u03c7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 is the word used in the 1550 Stephanus New Testament. This word means &#8220;follower of Christ&#8221; or, depending on the translation, &#8220;little Christ&#8221;.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The <strong>disciples<\/strong> were called <strong>Christians<\/strong> first at Antioch.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Acts 11:25-26 NIV<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>All of the followers of Christ were disciples. Nobody ever dared to call himself a Christian. It was a derogatory term used to condemn people. So what happened that suddenly people are proud to call themselves &#8220;Christian&#8221; but not &#8220;disciples&#8221;? Is the word &#8220;disciple&#8221; too strong? They&#8217;re the same thing! So, if you&#8217;re still thinking that you&#8217;re one of these but not the other, you might need to check yourself. If you&#8217;re not a &#8220;disciple&#8221;, you&#8217;re not being a real Christian.<\/p>\n<p>Anyway, Jesus gave his disciples a new purpose for their lives. Now, their purpose in life is to go out and &#8220;fish for people&#8221;. Interestingly, this is Jesus&#8217;\u00a0first and last teaching according to Matthew and Mark just before his ascension to his disciples. Therefore it must hold some significance. Jesus gave his disciples a purpose to their lives. Now, Jesus taught everyone the same things. Why would that teaching change for me?\u00a0I&#8217;m\u00a0not an &#8220;apostle&#8221;!\u00a0Does that make me\u00a0exempt from Jesus&#8217; teaching? Is talking to someone too hard? Faith is not about having an intellectual idea that God exists. One\u00a0doesn&#8217;t\u00a0say that he\/she\u00a0has\u00a0faith that a chair will not break and then proceed to never sit on it! If somebody\u00a0has\u00a0faith that a chair will not break when he\/she\u00a0sits on it, he\/she\u00a0will sit on it. If I\u00a0have faith that Jesus is God, then I must\u00a0do something about it!<\/p>\n<p>I have to ask myself: am I about my purpose as a disciple of Christ? Since I go to school and have a job, is my purpose about my school, career, job, family? Is my purpose to please God or please myself?<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">Then Jesus came to them and said, \u201cAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.\u201d\u00a0\u2014 Matthew 28:18-20 NIV<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":297,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[10,12],"tags":[15,18,22,23,24,11,25],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Being Faithful - MARALKAN<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Being Faithful - MARALKAN\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"MARALKAN\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:publisher\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/marvin.alkantara\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:author\" content=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/marvin.alkantara\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"article:published_time\" content=\"2016-02-11T01:55:48+00:00\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:image\" content=\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/6347903993_0fd6d46661_o_d.jpg\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:width\" content=\"2300\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:height\" content=\"1533\" \/>\n\t<meta property=\"og:image:type\" content=\"image\/jpeg\" \/>\n<meta name=\"author\" content=\"marvin\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary_large_image\" \/>\n<meta name=\"twitter:label1\" content=\"Written by\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data1\" content=\"marvin\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:label2\" content=\"Est. reading time\" \/>\n\t<meta name=\"twitter:data2\" content=\"5 minutes\" \/>\n<script type=\"application\/ld+json\" class=\"yoast-schema-graph\">{\"@context\":\"https:\/\/schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Article\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/#article\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\"},\"author\":{\"name\":\"marvin\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/#\/schema\/person\/84e3ae8d8dfd86a0e2b94665846e61ce\"},\"headline\":\"Being Faithful\",\"datePublished\":\"2016-02-11T01:55:48+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2016-02-11T01:55:48+00:00\",\"mainEntityOfPage\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\"},\"wordCount\":957,\"commentCount\":1,\"publisher\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/#\/schema\/person\/84e3ae8d8dfd86a0e2b94665846e61ce\"},\"keywords\":[\"bible\",\"ILoveMyChurchICC\",\"Jesus\",\"life\",\"personal\",\"quiet time\",\"reading\"],\"articleSection\":[\"Notes\",\"Quiet Times\"],\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"CommentAction\",\"name\":\"Comment\",\"target\":[\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/#respond\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"WebPage\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\",\"url\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\",\"name\":\"Being Faithful - MARALKAN\",\"isPartOf\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/#website\"},\"datePublished\":\"2016-02-11T01:55:48+00:00\",\"dateModified\":\"2016-02-11T01:55:48+00:00\",\"breadcrumb\":{\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/#breadcrumb\"},\"inLanguage\":\"en-US\",\"potentialAction\":[{\"@type\":\"ReadAction\",\"target\":[\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/\"]}]},{\"@type\":\"BreadcrumbList\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/being-faithful\/#breadcrumb\",\"itemListElement\":[{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":1,\"name\":\"Home\",\"item\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/\"},{\"@type\":\"ListItem\",\"position\":2,\"name\":\"Being Faithful\"}]},{\"@type\":\"WebSite\",\"@id\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/#website\",\"url\":\"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/\",\"name\":\"MARALKAN\",\"description\":\"Disciple.
