Many people like to say, &#8220;by grace we have been saved&#8221;. But I had to ask myself the question. What does grace mean? Why are there so many doctrines that differ on the concept of salvation by grace? Why do people say that they want to continue sinning so that God can have more grace?<\/p>\n<p>I was recently able to share a bit of my testimony in front of my church. It was challenging to say the least. Not the part about speaking in front of the crowd, but the part about being sincere and being vulnerable to the point of shedding a tear or two.<\/p>\n<p>This is what I shared:<\/p>\n<p>When I think of the cross, I think grace. I don&#8217;t know about you, but I am a messed up person. There are so many things that I&#8217;d like to claim that I can do well. I have a knack for working with computers, learning languages, for learning and expressing myself clearly. Cool! None of it matters&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Turn with me to Ephesians 2.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>As for you, you were <strong>dead<\/strong> in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions\u2014it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the <strong>gift of God<\/strong>\u2014 not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus <strong>to do good works<\/strong>, which God prepared in advance for us to do.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I reflected on this passage. I was dead in my transgressions and sins. I was the kind of guy that nobody would hang around with. I have messed up so many times in my life, it&#8217;s impossible to say that <em>I&#8217;m<\/em> not a sinner.<\/p>\n<p>When I was in high school, I had so much pride in myself! I used to think that I was the smartest at school. I would honestly believe that I was smarter\u00a0than all of the students there. I joined the Academic Decathlon in order to fulfill\u00a0my desire to be glorified. I thought that I would win medals and awards and scholarships and get so much glory. I was wrong. All I did was push people away. People who genuinely wanted to be my friends, I would punch them and tell them that they were worthless and not worth my time. Others I didn&#8217;t have the patience for. I met a guy who was so humble and so grateful that I even spoke to him. And I pushed him away too. I had no friends. And I had the illusion that my teacher was my friend. Just because he kept telling me that I was smart and &#8220;going places&#8221;. I delighted to think that the people who would bully me in middle school would be my employees one day or that I would make them suffer for what they did to me. I thought that by\u00a0proving my parents wrong I would somehow get them to say that they were proud of me. They often told me so. But I felt nothing when they did say it. Because I felt the emptiness of vain glory. I hurt people and didn&#8217;t care. But I couldn&#8217;t figure out why I was so empty. I didn&#8217;t get <em>any<\/em> medals at the end of the competition. I cried that day. I was bitter at everyone. Everyone had a smile on their face. Everyone had worked hard and was friends with someone else. Everyone had the dream life.<\/p>\n<p>Moving forward, I got into UC Berkeley. Hooray! [sarcasm]. I became worse. But now that I really didn&#8217;t know anyone, I felt the loneliness. My parents and family were not there anymore. I began to see how other students would sabotage each other&#8217;s work in order to be the top of the class. I began to see so much darkness in the world. I thought that I had it going and I had nothing. I messed up. I messed up thinking that I could go on living in impurity, insecurity, etc. I was not the smartest guy anymore. Everyone had equal or greater capacity. Mostly greater capacity. I was humbled out. I lost so much faith in my own ability. I thought that I had nothing to bring to this world. I wanted to leave the world.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0evening that I would go ahead with that plan, one of the guys who lived on the same floor as I did in the dorms literally had to drag me out of my room in order to get me to come to church. Now, it wasn&#8217;t the church that would tell me how to get saved, but it was\u00a0definitely a wake-up call. I was raised in a religious household. I was sick of God. But this time, I resonated with the message of hope. I had lived a life of sin. I was heartless, prideful, insecure, impure, hateful, dissensuous, immoral, and worst of all, guilty.<\/p>\n<p>I studied the Bible and started seeking God with all my heart. And on March 20, 2015, I was baptized for the forgiveness of my sins. I made a decision to live my life as a disciple of Christ. Did I stop sinning the way I did? I tried my best not to sin, but I had to learn and unlearn at the same time. I would argue with people about who was right about the Bible and who wasn&#8217;t. I made mistake after mistake after mistake. I do not deserve forgiveness. And yet, I have forgiveness. I do not deserve the love of God and yet I have it. I do not deserve the death of Christ, and yet He has risen. Grace simply means that God had mercy. God had mercy on a hopeless sinner like myself. God gave it all for me. Why should I continue sinning? And yet I continue to sin. However, it is most definitely <strong><em>not<\/em><\/strong> a license for me to sin.<\/p>\n<p>But I still have one message of hope. As I think of the cross, I think of Romans 5:8<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>I have been made alive in Christ. I am no longer subject to the pain of sin. I am no longer defined by my sin. I have hope! And I would be selfish and heartless not to share this hope with someone else.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[10,12],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/407"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=407"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/407\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=407"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=407"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=407"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
