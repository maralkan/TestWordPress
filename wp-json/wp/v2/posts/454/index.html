On arriving there, they went to the Jewish synagogue. Now the Berean Jews were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true. As a result, many of them believed, as did also a number of prominent Greek women and many Greek men.&nbsp;\u2014 Acts 17:10-12 NIV<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So there are many things that people can say about doctrines. They feel this about this Scripture and not that one. They feel that about the other Scripture. And you&#8217;re sitting there thinking, &#8220;where are you getting this from?&#8221; Or maybe you&#8217;re just sitting there agreeing without taking a second look.<\/p>\n<p>I am part of a movement of churches that believes in studying the Scriptures for yourself so as to not get entangled by people&#8217;s opinions about any given topic (Acts 17:10-12). If there is a difference in &#8220;interpretation&#8221;, we bring it to light and we all get unified on what we believe. As such, there are many Scriptures that are very straightforward and do not require &#8220;interpretation&#8221;. Others, such as prophecies, require further study. An big example, is the study of the coming of the Kingdom of God. There are many prophecies about it in Isaiah, Daniel, Joel, and other prophets that came about during the time of the Babylonian exile. But good study reveals that all these prophecies are fulfilled in the book of Acts.<\/p>\n<p>Then we have the topic of denominations. Why are there so many denominations of Christianity? Why is there so much division in a movement that is supposed to be one Church?<\/p>\n<p>As a whole movement of Christianity, what makes us different from other religions? How are we different from Theraveda or Mahayana Buddhism? From Islam? From Judaism? What makes us different? How is our pursuit of salvation different from other religious traditions?<\/p>\n<p>These are some of the thoughts and questions I was having. Whatever the cause of these questions, these are questions that shook and rocked my world recently. I did research into these religious traditions. I searched for answers that I thought I had already found. My lack of discipline in my quiet times with God had brought me to this point. Ultimately, I was about to give up on Christianity.<\/p>\n<p>I related to Solomon&#8217;s thought process in Ecclesiastes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Meaningless! Meaningless!&#8221; says the Teacher.&nbsp;&#8220;Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.&#8221;&nbsp;\u2014 Ecclesiastes 1:2 NIV<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Then I applied myself to the understanding of wisdom, and also of madness and folly, but I learned that this, too, is a chasing after the wind. For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.&nbsp;\u2014 Ecclesiastes 1:17-18 NIV<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Nothing meant anything to me. I was wondering whether things were really as they were. I lost myself in thought and missed class and work. I couldn&#8217;t figure things out. I was stuck in habitual sins but wondering whether or not these were really sins. I was questioning the nature of Creation, the nature of God, the heart, the soul, how connected an action is to the soul, how one can say that someone else is saved. And I realized that the more I searched for answers, the less satisfied I became with them. I decided that instead of searching for a revelation or some emotional experience, I would instead look at things as objectively as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In Christianity, the life of Jesus and his relationship to God&nbsp;is the distinguishing trait of the religious tradition. In Buddhism, the teaching and reaching nirvana, the breaking of samsara is what is essential to the religious tradition. In Judaism, there is a hope and an expectation of God&#8217;s messiah to continue to rebuke the people of God. In Islam, there is the teaching and following of Mohammad. What makes me different?<\/p>\n<p>At the age of 5, I was involved in an accident that sent me to the hospital. My dad was selling hot dogs in the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. Everyone loved his recipe and his business strategy. Soon hot dog stands like his sprang up all over Los Angeles. Everyone knew my dad. &#8220;Hot Dogs Adonai&#8221;, later renamed &#8220;Hot Dogs Jireh&#8221; was the name of my dad&#8217;s hot dog cart. It was during my aunt&#8217;s stay in our home.<\/p>\n<p>We had humble circumstances. We weren&#8217;t living an extravagant life. But it was a life so much better than my parents had when they lived in Mexico. So on October 9th, 1999, my dad was selling his hot dogs just like every other day. My aunt was standing in the shade and she complained about the heat. My dad had a feeling that something was wrong. He smelled a gas leak. I was curious. He opened the bottom compartment to the cart and looked in. That&#8217;s when it happened. The gas made contact with the flame. I saw the flame shoot through the gas in the air and straight into the compartment my dad was looking into. The propane tank exploded in his face and the blast hit me all over my body. All I remember is the feeling of needles pinching and pulling my skin off. That&#8217;s the best way I can describe the pain I felt. I saw my mom rush over to me. My dad was slapping his face putting out flames. My mom lifted me onto a chair and was slapping my face with wet hands dousing the flames on my skin. I passed out. I remember haziness and an ambulance. I remember thinking it was so cool to be in an ambulance. The paramedics were putting needles into my arms and my mom was crying on the side. I passed out. I woke up at the hospital. They were taking me to a metal bin. They scrubbed my skin with steel wool. The 3rd degree burns were so deep that I felt as if the flames had engulfed me once more. Skin fell off.<\/p>\n<p>I later found myself&nbsp;wrapped in white cloth in bed. I couldn&#8217;t move. I got one visitor, my pre-kindergarten teacher. I spent several months in recovery. There were many scary moments. There was a time that I flat-lined. They didn&#8217;t revive me and the medics&nbsp;gave up on me. And my mom protested. They were getting ready to cart me out and to bring in the next patient when I woke up asking why I hadn&#8217;t&nbsp;been taken to Griffith Park. Medics rushed in and out and some even&nbsp;covered their faces and ran out&nbsp;to the balcony and prayed to God (it was obvious). I moved back home and continued in recovery. Today I have no deep scars. I only have some small marks on my arms and hands that&nbsp;people do not notice unless I point it out.<\/p>\n<p>I say all this because this is the first time I believed in God. This is not because of my parents indoctrinating me with their personal beliefs. It was of my own accord. I wanted to learn more.&nbsp;I was 5 years old and didn&#8217;t know how to appreciate life. So this fervor quickly died out.<\/p>\n<p>When I began college, I began to question the idea of God. I wondered why I believed in God and had forgotten about this miracle that I had seen. It wasn&#8217;t long before I found myself in depression and stuck in ruts everywhere. I had no motivation and no zeal for learning. I just wanted to escape the world into&nbsp;fantasies. This led to many things. Sin after sin. It was then that I revisited my questions from childhood. I began to go to church at the request of one of my friends from college. Ultimately he felt that he didn&#8217;t need God. But I kept going. And I felt all the emotions and went to worship with a lot of people who had good hearts. But I was not taught to be a follower. I was not taught to be a worshiper in spirit and truth (John 4:23-24). I&nbsp;was later kicked out of school&nbsp;due to bad grades and my lack of understanding of how to manage life. I had to admit defeat to my parents and my family. My family had such high hopes for me and they were very disappointed. My parents, on the other hand, were very joyful to have me back home.<\/p>\n<p>I began to attend a community college with the intent of returning to UC Berkeley. But my greatest challenge and time of learning came from my time at the community college. I learned to study the Bible and to teach the Bible. I learned what it meant to remain faithful and to be&nbsp;a pure man for God. It&#8217;s when I was baptized and began discipleship.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also the time that I&nbsp;began to try and learn wisdom and understanding from other cultures and other peoples. Specifically, I was interested in Japanese culture and religious philosophy. But that led me to more questioning. I was again caught up in&nbsp;trying to escape reality. Life got difficult. I watched more anime. I read other books and not my Bible. I watched all sorts of dramas that didn&#8217;t help me grow. Slowly I began to poison my thinking and to fall away in my heart.<\/p>\n<p>So about going with the correct doctrine, I decided to look at my questions. After one month of questioning with no research and no effort made into reconciling with God, I went back to the Bible. I decided to pray to God once more.<\/p>\n<p>I believe in a soul I believe that Jesus is God. I considered the psychoanalyses of Jesus and determined that he wasn&#8217;t just some crazy guy claiming to be God. He wasn&#8217;t lying. People have waged wars and have lost their lives for this belief. Countless martyrs have battled these other philosophies and found them fruitless. How can you know that you&#8217;ve lived before and have had past lives? I can&#8217;t really know. How can you know what there is after this life? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe it&#8217;s emptiness and maybe it&#8217;s another life. But I know that there is a man who claimed to be God and died for all. This act of love is&nbsp;a greater truth than anything I&#8217;ve ever seen.<\/p>\n<p>If God so loved the world, and many people claim to be Christian, why is there so much hatred and sin in the world? They haven&#8217;t repented of their sins. They falsely call themselves Christian. They falsely claim to love others. But at the same time, there are people who are genuinely disciples of Christ. And can be very misunderstood because of one action where they let their sinful nature get the best of them. There is only what we know and what we can know. The rest is faith. We walk in faith. I choose this path of faith because it&#8217;s what&nbsp;makes the most sense. Buddhist teachings are not quite there.&nbsp;I can actually say that someone died for me. The Buddha didn&#8217;t die for me. He didn&#8217;t even want to share his great revelation. He did it anyway but he died. He will not come back and rescue. Even the Mahayana branch that refuses to fully achieve nirvana cannot say that they love as Jesus Christ did. Islam&nbsp;describes Jesus as a greater prophet than Mohammad. I am still learning. But learning without God is meaningless. Nobody&nbsp;will benefit. And working for others&nbsp;who do not understand what things are for is pointless. My purpose is simply to live for God. I repented of all my sins. I have considered that Creation alone is not the divine reality. Cause and effect&nbsp;is real. God is real.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.&nbsp;\u2014 Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 NIV<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":489,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[10,12],"tags":[15,18,23,11],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/454"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=454"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/454\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/489"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=454"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=454"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/maralcan.local\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=454"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
