										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span id="more-699"></span></p>
<p>Today I read Jeremiah 6. A section dedicated entirely to explaining the hard-heartedness of the Israelite nation. I am just posting my notes.</p>
<p>The alarms aren&#8217;t sounding&#8230; God has warned his people of the consequences of their sin. Nobody listens. In fact, they shut their ears.</p>
<p>This is why the anger of God burns&#8230; They do not listen!</p>
<p>v14. To dress a wound improperly as though it were not serious is a very serious deceit. This hardening goes from the leaders to the people. If the leaders aren&#8217;t ashamed of their own conduct, the people won&#8217;t be ashamed either.&nbsp;This leads to a definitive hardening in the hearts of many.</p>
<p>v16. This is a crossroads. Every time I get discipling, it is a crossroads. I can choose to follow God&#8217;s way or my own way. God&#8217;s way: the good way, where I will find rest for my soul.</p>
<p>This is a case of discipline. When I was younger, my mom would often discipline me by threatening to make an example of me in front of my classmates. Man.. how I feared that! I feared that my deeds would be exposed. I feared that I would be exposed as some sort of incredibly immature guy. For a long time, I held on to this fear. And my mom never came through with the threats. I hardened myself to her and resisted her discipline. I&#8217;m very grateful that God did this for me. Later on, I would be disciplined by my brother in the church and, initially, I resisted and didn&#8217;t understand what was going on. And all that pains me now is that anyone with a hardened heart cannot please God. I couldn&#8217;t please my mom because I had started to dislike her and her discipline.</p>
<p>v20. Sacrifices that are fancy, much labor, or even great sacrifices aren&#8217;t pleasing to God and are, in fact, worship in vain when my heart is hard.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Lord says:&nbsp;&#8220;These people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.&nbsp;Their worship of me is based on merely human rules they have been taught&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;— Isaiah 29:13 NIV</p></blockquote>
<p>These sacrifices aren&#8217;t even acceptable!</p>
<p>v22. God will bring discipline! God warned his people and then disaster struck.</p>
<p>v26.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.&#8221;&nbsp;— Jeremiah 6:26 NIV</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is the hand of God, not Satan. God disciplining and allowing his people to suffer the consequences so that the remnant can turn back to him.</p>
<p>When a metal caster is trying to extract metal from an ore, the ore must be refined. One must purify the metal. This purification involves a furnace that must increase in intensity until all impurities are gone. In this case, God had put his people into the furnace and the impurities were so deeply embedded that the metal would be nearly destroyed. And so the refining process was done in vain. And God rejected the ore.</p>
<h3>What do?</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to have a hardened heart. I don&#8217;t want to have this kind of heart towards God. This makes the situation difficult for me and for everyone else around me. So why would I want to make this a difficult situation?</p>
<p>I have been in some difficult situations recently that involved a lot of sin on my part and sin on the part of some of my brothers. It was due to a character flaw in myself that happened to expose many hearts. All sin is bad. And these situations should never have happened. God isn&#8217;t planning on having me sin to refine other peoples&#8217; hearts. I must improve my character so that I won&#8217;t risk being a stumbling block to my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I have a new plan. Don&#8217;t try and look for flaws in someone else. Rather, just love everyone else and encourage as necessary. Prevent sin and make every effort to be at peace with everyone around me. This means that I must love everyone for who they are and not make prejudicial conclusions. I cannot pull my heart away from others. I must give my all.</p>
<p>At home. I must obey and honor my parents as I honor God. I will not sin if they ask me to (as they often ask me to do so). But I will honor them by obeying, giving, loving, and most of all, persevering in my life and doctrine (1 Timothy 4:16).</p>
<blockquote><p>And has just been said: &#8220;Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion.&#8221;&nbsp;— Hebrews 3:15 NIV</p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace.&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span id="more-390"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. — Colossians 3:15-17</p></blockquote>
<p>We were charged to write a letter to God in order to connect with God at a more personal level and to be more grateful for what He has done in our lives. As grateful followers/disciples, we can go out and actually evangelize this world. Gratitude is something that I&#8217;ve noticed brings a lot of repentance and change in people. No matter where they come from.</p>
<p>I include my letter here.</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>I am very glad that I can talk to you this morning. Thank you for the privilege of being able to write this letter to you. Thank you God for always being there to bring in a new day. You keep the stars in their current trajectories. You keep the sun in it&#8217;s place. You allow the Earth to continue rotating on it&#8217;s axis at the particular angle that it is tilted at. You stand at eternity radiating peace, love, patience, kindness, joy.</p>
<p>I am nothing like you God. And yet you cared enough to make man in your image. Something that we, as your creations, are unable to do. We cannot create another person from scratch. And if we do, it&#8217;s with your materials. We can&#8217;t create our atoms from scratch. We can&#8217;t do anything without you, God.</p>
<p>I was listening to some songs where the singer expresses lots of gratitude towards their best friend. And these are people who don&#8217;t really know you, God! How can I say that I&#8217;ve been grateful to you? Please forgive me for being so ungrateful to you. I haven&#8217;t even stopped to think about how much you&#8217;ve done for me for quite a while, now. Thank you God for always being there for me. You were there when I was burned and in the hospital. When I cried out in prayer and the nurses and doctors were telling my mom to shut me up. And yet they witnessed a miracle in front of their eyes. I should not even be alive if it weren&#8217;t for you. Yet again, when I&#8217;ve been in danger multiple times in my life. Running in the streets of Downtown Oakland in the night, fearing that I would be jumped or taken hostage by someone. When you protected me from many more things. I&#8217;ve had my life placed in so many dangerous situations and yet I continue to live. Thank you God for not giving up on me.</p>
<p>There have been times when I trust people more than I trusted you. Primarily, it was before I was a disciple. But even as a disciple, I&#8217;ve placed my trust in people. When it was revealed, I was broken and realized that it was you that I needed, not the love of someone else. I was trying to be in a situation where I felt loved by someone here on earth. But then I realized that I&#8217;m not trying to store up treasures for myself here on earth. Why was I trying to do that? I didn&#8217;t trust you, God. But I realize now that you were always there.</p>
<p>You were there when I felt so discouraged and lonely in Berkeley. I have a feeling you were probably whispering in my ear, telling me to seek after you. To not follow through with the desires to end it all. I didn&#8217;t end it all. I ended up at the TSF. Although it wasn&#8217;t the right place to be at, it was the right place at the right time. You set up the times and places for everyone. For my family. For myself. You are the one who made it all possible. You kept me alive. You allowed me to experience the world as I did. I was betrayed, trusted, betrayed again. And I saw the hearts of people turn away from me. And yet I didn&#8217;t learn my lesson. I didn&#8217;t understand that I was still trusting in men. Even for a while as a disciple, I still felt led by people and not by you. But you were still there. You were faithful even though I was not.</p>
<p>You also gave me the family that I have today. They love me. And there are times when I am ungrateful towards them. I yell at them, letting them know that I&#8217;m a person as well (at least, in my mind). I thought that by yelling at them I would stop them from yelling at me. (haha I was so wrong). When I thought that they were against me because they did not let me do the Academic Decathlon, I was extremely rebellious. And yet, you allowed that to happen. You allowed me to go to Sam K. and let him know that he&#8217;s better than my parents. I sincerely thought he was looking out for me more than my own parents were. I still have confusion about that. I don&#8217;t understand what my parents motives were. I don&#8217;t understand Sam&#8217;s motivations. All I know is that my motivations were selfish. I had an intense selfish ambition. I wanted to feel honored and respected by everyone else. I wanted to hear that I was better than someone else. And I was very disappointed when I didn&#8217;t get it. And God, you obviously had a hand in that. My strong suit was supposed to be math. And I was failing at it. I understood how to do it. But, in practice, I couldn&#8217;t do it under pressure.</p>
<p>You gave me talent. There are many times that I&#8217;m afraid of saying that I can do things because I don&#8217;t want to be prideful. And by feeling that, I feel insecure. I want to be called humble. So paradoxical&#8230; and yet again, signs of pride. I really have nothing to bring to the table but the things that you&#8217;ve given me. I only ask that you allow me to use these talents to glorify you. Allow me to reach out with this. I can reach a community that is not often reached. I have access to some of the greatest minds, according to the wisdom of the world. And yet, I can sometimes let it slip. I feel lazy. I don&#8217;t feel like studying. I don&#8217;t feel like trying to glorify you. But you are still there.</p>
<p>Dad, you made me to glorify you and do your work. Thank you for giving me a new purpose for my life. Thank you for giving me friends who care. Thank you for allowing me to be in your kingdom. Thank you for allowing me to come clean to you. Thank you for your forgiveness.</p>
<p>Thank you, Jesus for your sacrifice. Thank you that because you denied yourself, I don&#8217;t have to suffer for eternity. Thank you that you&#8217;ve given me eyesight, hearing, language, normalcy in brain habit. Thank you for giving me the brothers and sister that I have. Thank you for testing my faith, that it may be refined by fire. Thank you for placing me in charge of websites. Thank you for placing me under Jeff and Jovanny. Thank you for teaching me your words. Thank you for answering my prayers with getting to know you. Thank you for bringing in so many souls. Thank you for my brothers and sisters around the world. Thank you for your love. Thank you for everything. Thank you for the job that I have. Thank you for allowing me to share with my co-workers alongside a fellow brother and disciple. Thank you for giving me clothing to wear. Thank you for giving me good to eat. Thank you for giving me a new computer. Thank you for giving me what I need. Thank you for giving me people to lead. I&#8217;m unworthy of receiving anything. I&#8217;m like the prodigal son. I don&#8217;t deserve it. I&#8217;m like the other soon, feeling like I deserve something that I really don&#8217;t. Thank you God.</p>
<p>You are awesome in everything that you do. You are incredible. You work great miracles in our day and age. You are patient, kind, loving, generous, faithful.</p>
<p>You gave it all for me. Why can&#8217;t I give it all to you? God, give me strength to carry on your dream. Give me strength to do your will when I cannot. All things come from you. All things are made by you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much more that I can pray about as well. Brothers and sisters around the world are struggling. Some are sick some are not. People in this world are suffering because of sin. Help them get closer to you. Give them what they need to seek you. For the workers in the harvest. Lord send me. Here I am Lord. Send me.</p>
<p>I very well would like to go to Japan. I would very much like to share with souls who need saving from their destructive worldview. Sometimes it&#8217;s mind boggling to me to see that people want yo believe in ghosts and not in you. People want yo believe in death, in demons, in statues, in money. People understand these things at the intellectual level but do not practice them. I saw that at bible talk. A woman tried to defend her independence from you. I could hear pride come out.</p>
<p>Thanks for all that you do!</p>
<p>-Your son,<br />
Marvin Alcántara</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Continuing on my reading of Mark, I realized one thing. Jesus loves us and therefore heals us. But not just&#8230;]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span id="more-363"></span>Continuing on my reading of Mark, I realized one thing. Jesus loves us and therefore heals us. But not just a superficial remedy. He heals completely and thoroughly, leaving no blemish behind.</p>
<p>In Mark 7, Jesus healed a deaf and mute man. Now, being sensitive to those who are deaf and mute, this is something that, according to the hearing world, is considered a disease of some sort. But Jesus did something incredible.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis. There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him.</p>
<p>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue. He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means “Be opened!”). At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly.</p>
<p>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.” — Mark 7:31-37 NIV</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, modern procedures for someone to hear requires Deaf people to have an intrusive device that looks obvious on them. These devices, can be very painful experiences to those who have lived deaf lives. I&#8217;ve heard many accounts of these hearing aids comparing the sudden influx of noise to a massive train wreck playing in our ears at volume levels too intense for us to bear. Deaf people with hearing aids must go through a lot in order to be part of the hearing world. Again, these hearing aids cause massive &#8220;migraine&#8221; headaches that are too much to bear.</p>
<p>But Jesus healed a man at a time when this was not even a possibility in people&#8217;s minds. Jesus installed a language into a man&#8217;s mind. He cured a man of would-be headaches and even have the man muscle memory for the tongue, that he would be able to speak possibly as if he had spoken the language his whole life. That&#8217;s amazing!</p>
<p>My major in school is cognitive science. Because of it, I&#8217;m able to appreciate the fact that this man had to receive a sudden influx of information into his brain, had to have many neural pathways changed, and he needed to have nerve paths hardened before Jesus&#8217;s fingers left the man&#8217;s ears. And that&#8217;s not even touching the fact that the man&#8217;s ears are now sensitive to sound. The cochlea, the inner ear, is now able to perceive sound the way it is supposed to. This man was also <em>probably</em> able to communicate the wonders of God and Jesus in sign language as well! This was definitely a contribution to the world evangelization described in the book of Acts. I say the word &#8220;probably&#8221; with caution; it&#8217;s not in the Bible!</p>
<p>Now, Jesus loved this man and healed him completely. I now ask myself this question&#8230; How do I love others? Do I love someone &#8220;just enough&#8221;? Or do I go out of my way to love my brothers, sisters, and those outside? I had a conversation with a fellow student regarding the Catholic faith. We differed on the basis that I hold the Bible to be the ultimate and final authority in all things related to God and my life. But he holds the Church to be the final authority and the Bible is merely a book of guidelines. We differ and I don&#8217;t hold it against him. But I do tell him to challenge his way of thinking. This is the primary way by which false doctrines came into the church. This is the main reason why so many people think they&#8217;re doing all things right. This is why people believe that they can be saved with a simple prayer. It&#8217;s because churches have subjected the Bible to be merely a book of guidelines. It&#8217;s not the Word of God. It&#8217;s instead just a set of inspired writings that have man&#8217;s intentions written all over them. He thinks that one receives salvation through the Eucharist tradition of the Catholic church.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much I know, I still will not be able to win him over using knowledge of the Scriptures. It&#8217;s loving excellently as Jesus did. It&#8217;s dying to myself and not getting into quarrels about knowledge. It&#8217;s truly living a pure life. It&#8217;s taking care of my life and my doctrine.</p>
<blockquote><p><sup>16</sup> Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers. — 1 Timothy 4:16</p></blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.</p>
<p>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</p>
<p>Jesus replied, “You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.”</p>
<p>Jesus answered, “Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</p>
<p>“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!”</p>
<p>12 When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. “Do you understand what I have done for you?” he asked them. “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.” — John 13:1-9, 12-17 NIV</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Just as Jesus loved, so I should love. There are times when I don&#8217;t feel like loving my brother. But how can I love God, who I can&#8217;t see, if I can&#8217;t love my brother, who I can see? Jesus loved excellently. I will do so as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">-M</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span id="more-240"></span>Today, I&#8217;m continuing to read Mark&#8217;s account of the ministry of Jesus. I think it&#8217;s interesting how Jesus had a heart to help everyone but wanted to remain on the down low until it was his time. Curiously, there&#8217;s the aspect of Jesus that many people can often overlook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where <strong>he prayed</strong>. Simon and his companions went to look for him, and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. <strong>That is why I have come</strong>.” So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. — Mark 1:35-39 NIV</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Prayer and Reading</h3>
<p>Jesus had a daily relationship with God. As I learn to imitate Christ, I must have a daily relationship with God. How can I be best friends with someone if I don&#8217;t talk to them? How can I say I love God if I don&#8217;t talk to him or read his Word? Again, I can reference Romans 10:17 NIV.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the <strong>word about Christ</strong>. — Romans 10:17 NIV</p>

<p>Jesus had a daily relationship with God. But another thing to note, is that he always had time with God before he did anything throughout the day. We don&#8217;t have his prayer but it&#8217;s probably for strength. Why would anyone want to love people who are only interested in you because you provide some sort of advantage and no real friendship? Jesus prayed and then he decided to go elsewhere so that others may hear his preaching. So far, the only thing we know is that he has preached about the coming of the kingdom of God. And since the kingdom of God has come near, people must repent and believe that it is good news!</p>
<p>But what does this message that he preaches have to do with Christ? In a future post, I will talk about the kingdom of God in further detail. But it leaves me with obvious impression that Jesus is not preaching about himself. He is preaching about something important that is to come and is very near.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>When Jesus told his first disciples to follow him, he talked to fishermen with words that they knew about. He used their profession to explain to them that he has a new purpose for them. Now, these are his disciples. Today, people think that a disciple is so much more than a Christian. A Christian, for some reason, means that you go to church and have some sort of intellectual belief in a supernatural being that he/she calls God. But a disciple is a follower, a student, a friend, an apprentice. How are they different? Is a disciple more faithful than a Christian? Is a Christian then, some term that you can use freely to say that you believe in a supernatural being?</p>
<p>In the Greek, χριστιανους is the word used in the 1550 Stephanus New Testament. This word means &#8220;follower of Christ&#8221; or, depending on the translation, &#8220;little Christ&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The <strong>disciples</strong> were called <strong>Christians</strong> first at Antioch. — Acts 11:25-26 NIV</p></blockquote>
<p>All of the followers of Christ were disciples. Nobody ever dared to call himself a Christian. It was a derogatory term used to condemn people. So what happened that suddenly people are proud to call themselves &#8220;Christian&#8221; but not &#8220;disciples&#8221;? Is the word &#8220;disciple&#8221; too strong? They&#8217;re the same thing! So, if you&#8217;re still thinking that you&#8217;re one of these but not the other, you might need to check yourself. If you&#8217;re not a &#8220;disciple&#8221;, you&#8217;re not being a real Christian.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jesus gave his disciples a new purpose for their lives. Now, their purpose in life is to go out and &#8220;fish for people&#8221;. Interestingly, this is Jesus&#8217; first and last teaching according to Matthew and Mark just before his ascension to his disciples. Therefore it must hold some significance. Jesus gave his disciples a purpose to their lives. Now, Jesus taught everyone the same things. Why would that teaching change for me? I&#8217;m not an &#8220;apostle&#8221;! Does that make me exempt from Jesus&#8217; teaching? Is talking to someone too hard? Faith is not about having an intellectual idea that God exists. One doesn&#8217;t say that he/she has faith that a chair will not break and then proceed to never sit on it! If somebody has faith that a chair will not break when he/she sits on it, he/she will sit on it. If I have faith that Jesus is God, then I must do something about it!</p>
<p>I have to ask myself: am I about my purpose as a disciple of Christ? Since I go to school and have a job, is my purpose about my school, career, job, family? Is my purpose to please God or please myself?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” — Matthew 28:18-20 NIV</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span id="more-189"></span>I decided to switch up my reading. Instead of reading Jeremiah, I will read the gospels. I realized late last night that I need to have more faith to be able to be strong in all situations. (Romans 10:17 NIV)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">And a voice came from heaven: &#8220;You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.&#8221; — Mark 1:11 NIV</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">A Christian is a follower of Jesus. Therefore, an imitator of Jesus. God was well pleased with Jesus. Therefore, as I imitate Christ, God will be pleased with me just as Jesus pleased him in his time. What&#8217;s crazy is that God has long encouraged prophets to remain steadfast and to know his heart. But this time it was different. This time, God was pleased with Jesus before he had started his ministry! Already, this distinguishes Jesus from all of the prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The question here is, how do I imitate Christ? Simple, I must learn what Jesus did and taught. How do I learn that? I can&#8217;t rely on anyone to teach me. I must do it for myself. It&#8217;s my personal relationship with God.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So then, what are the teachings of Jesus? I guess I&#8217;m going to learn more and more as I continue to read the Bible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">Application for Today</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Today, it seems, I will have to follow the example of Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Love must be sincere.</strong> Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. <strong>Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves.</strong> Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be conceited.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. <strong>If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.</strong> Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. On the contrary:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;<br />
if he is thirsty, give him something to drink.<br />
In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.”<br />
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. — Romans 12:9-21 NIV</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">and</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">We love because he first loved us. Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a <strong>liar</strong>. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, <strong>cannot love God</strong>, whom they have not seen. And <strong>he has given us this command</strong>: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister. — 1 John 4:19-21 NIV</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">Christ taught many times throughout his time on earth and through his apostles&#8217; writings that we must have love for one another. I can imitate Christ by having love for my brothers (<em>adelphoi</em> means brothers and sisters). How can I love my brothers? I can definitely start by changing my character. So many times, I thought that everyone else had to change because I was doing everything right. I love people, I give sacrificially, I do more things (in my opinion) than others. But that doesn&#8217;t make me righteous. When someone ignores me I get butthurt and I tend to pull away my love because I think it&#8217;s not worth it to love a person who will not appreciate my love. But Christ commands us to love as he did. He loved despite the rejection of the apostles when he was turned in to the authorities. He loved always. So I must also always love even in the face of rejection. That way, I will overcome evil with good. That way I can imitate Christ and live a life pleasing to God.</p>
